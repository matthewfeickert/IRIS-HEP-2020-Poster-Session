# NSF-Review-IRIS-HEP-Poster
Poster on pyhf for NSF 18-Month Review of IRIS-HEP poster session

Posters need to be sized 30" x 40" and file format in PDF.
The posters should be generic with no mention of the NSF review on the poster.
The audience is our reviewers which are typically not high-energy physicists - so avoid lingo.  Simple and clear posters are definitely preferred.
